# Enemy Overhaul

## Overview

This mod includes small behaviour tweaks for some enemies and completely rewritten AI for others, all with the goal of giving enemies unique, fun, and deadly quirks.

Now configurable! Fine-grained control of enemy behaviours, damage, and other things is planned to be added in the future. Changing configuration during menus is also supported now. Do not change configuration during levels, as it may break AI until the next stage.

Enemy Overhaul is currently under active development, so expect bugs and wonky behaviour from enemies. Please submit an issue to the github if you want something to be fixed! More enemies may be 'improved' in the future.

## Changes

**BEWARE: SPOILERS AHEAD**

### Trudge

The Trudge no longer cares as much about the pesky players, rather that the truck and extraction points they bring with them are loud and annoying. 
- Trudges will slowly make their way towards extractions when active, or quickly approach the ship otherwise.
- After arriving, the Trudge will destroy the extraction / truck, resulting in at best a fine, and at worst uncontrollable self destruction.
- Luckily, the Trudge can be distracted, and will charge after any player that annoys it too much.

### Robe

The Robe has had a change of heart, and only wants to try its best to help the team, but it has some anger issues.
- The Robe will now follow players around, and won't attack unless provoked.
- If the player the Robe is following grabs a heavy item, the Robe will help out and allow for easier lifting.
- The Robe becomes a lot less friendly after the last extraction. (WIP)

### Reaper

The Reaper has always been a bit empty-headed, and now she can get pretty scared.
- The Reaper will chase players, increasing in speed and damage over time.
- If hurt enough, the Reaper will get scared and flee from the players.

- You can tumble-launch to scare it... as long as you hit it.

### Pits

The worst enemy of all, holes, now come equipped with handy spiked teleporters.
- After falling into a pit, any entity (including you!) will take heavy damage and 'fall from the sky' into a nearby room, rather than being instantly annihilated.

### Headman

The Headman is fine with having guests over, as long as they don't steal...
- The Headman is more passive, but will be quick to show displeasure when spotting a player holding valuable items.
- If toyed with for too long, the Headman will chase the player much more quickly than default, doing increased damage, and making sure that you aren't stealing any more items.
  
### Huntsman

- The Huntsman's gun now has damage falloff, with increased damage at close range to compensate.
- The Huntsman lost on of his ears, and will now give players much more warning before firing.

### Gnome

More changes coming eventually!
- Reduced damage to items.
