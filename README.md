# Enemy Overhaul

This mod includes small behaviour tweaks for some enemies and completely rewritten AI for others, all with the goal of giving enemies unique, fun, and deadly quirks.

Enemy Overhaul is currently under active development, so expect bugs and wonky behaviour from enemies. Please submit an issue to the github if you want something to be fixed! More enemies may be 'improved' in the future.

Config is not currently available, so you're stuck with all my stupid changes for the moment, but it might be added in the future if I feel like it.

If you're interested in fixing one of my many mistakes, feel free to submit a pull request that I won't notice for a week because I don't check my email!

## Changes

Find out for yourself! It's no fun if you know what's happening. (or read the code you nerd!)
